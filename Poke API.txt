📁 Project: Pokemon TCG Viewer Web App

🎯 Main Goal:
Migrate a working S3 prototype to a fully-deployed, GitHub-linked, Amplify Gen 2 app using:
- DynamoDB
- Lambda (data sync)
- API Gateway (frontend-backend bridge)
- S3 (CSV backup)
- CloudWatch (logs + metrics)

🧠 Context:
- Gen 2 setup is complete and connected to GitHub
- Latest successful Amplify deployment detected Gen 2
- Repo is pokemon-tcg-viewer, hosted on GitHub and Amplify
- Lambda Python code needs to be converted to TypeScript
- File structure includes `lambda/`, `public/`, `archive/`, and new `amplify/`

🪜 Current 5-Step Plan:
1. ✅ Clean + restructure file system ✅
2. ✅ Upgrade to Amplify Gen 2 with GitHub-based deployment ✅
3. 🔄 Define backend in `amplify/backend.ts` (DynamoDB + Lambda + API Gateway)
4. 🛠 Build API routes + test Lambda-DynamoDB sync
5. 📊 Integrate CloudWatch and finalize production deployment

📌 Next task: Convert `lambda_function.py` to `lambda_function.ts` and define `backend.ts`
